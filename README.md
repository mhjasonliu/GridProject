# GridProject
Small project where I was experimenting with different ways to work with a grid.

Half Chess is a project inspired by a game I learned about when I was a kid, which uses Chinese Chess pieces
to make a game on a 4 by 8 grid. In the game, I was experimenting in Java with using classes to make it easier to read.

myGrid is a grid which experiments with mechanisms in which grid spaces interact with adjacent spaces.
I used a few functions to try to simulate fluid flow on the board. They turned out quite interesting and beautiful.
I also had some fun implementing Conway's game of life.
